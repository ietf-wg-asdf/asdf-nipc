This memo specifies RESTful application layer interface for non-IP
operations.  The interface initially describes Bluetooth Low
Energy and Zigbee.

Introduction
============

There has been an explosion of non-IP devices to support
manufacturing, healthcare, the home, and the office.  At the same
time, wireless access points have been deployed nearly everywhere,
many of which have soft or separate radios that can transmit and
receive different frame types, such as {{BLE53}}.  To avoid the need for
parallel infrastructure, a gateway control function is necessary.

The gateway provides the following functions:
 - authentication and authorization of application clients that
   will access devices
 - maintenance of an inventory of devices that are intended to
   access and be accessed by the deployment and applications.
 - a map of which APs should be communicating with the endpoints.
 - one or more channels to process requests, responses, and asymmetric
   communciations.

Combined with a provisioning interface such as
{{!I-D.shahzad-scim-device-model}}, this specification supports
these aspects.

{: #arch title="Basic Architecture"}

{{arch}} shows us the application layer gateway (ALG), an access
point (AP), and a device (D) in the enterprise environment.  The role
of the ALG is to select the appropriate AP.

This specification is organized into three sections:

- Basic control functions described in narrative.
- A specifation that can be mapped to a publication/subscribe
  interface, such as MQTT.
- OpenAPI and Protobufs definitions for the above

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

Basic Control
=============

Here provide narrative descriptions for the control endpoints we are
defining.

Publish/Subscribe Interface
===========================

Here provide a narrative description of the pub/sub interface.


Security Considerations
=======================

Too early.

IANA Considerations
===================

Too early.

OpenAPI definitions
===================

Here provide the OpenAPI definitions for control interface.

Protobufs definitions
=====================

Here provide protobufs definitions for telemetry interface.
